                                    The Free Hit chip can be used twice during the 2021/22 season, with the second Free Hit
                                    available to managers from
                                    Gameweek 20. Managers who haven't played their Free Hit ahead of Gameweek 20 will not
                                    lose their first, they will have
                                    two Free Hit chips available to them.

                                    The Free Hit chip is played when confirming your transfers and can't be cancelled after
                                    confirmed. You can't play the
                                    Free Hit chip in consecutive Gameweeks.

                                    The Wildcard chip can be used twice a season, once in the first half of the season and
                                    once in the second half of the season. The Wildcard chip is played when confirming

                                    can't be cancelled once played.
